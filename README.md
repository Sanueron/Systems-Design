# Systems-Design
When writing code for games and projects, is highly recommended to plan ahead the flow of data through scripts. In this learning series I will share some basic Systems Design, hoping this can be helpful to any developer.

Note that these systems must be adjusted to every project needs, so be sure to use them as a guide to make your own systems within your projects rather than following blindly each step.
Do not hesitate to reach me for further details.
